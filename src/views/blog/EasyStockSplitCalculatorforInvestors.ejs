            <h2>Understanding Stock Splits</h2>
            <h3>What is a Stock Split?</h3>
            <p>A stock split is when a company increases the number of its outstanding <a href="https://www.marketbeat.com/stock-splits/calculator/">shares</a>. At the same time, the price per share goes down.</p>
            <%- include('../ads/innerarticleads-01') %>
            <p>Existing shareholders get more shares, but each share is worth less. Companies do this to make their stock more
                affordable to more investors. This can increase liquidity and attract more interest in the stock.</p>
            <p>A stock split doesn't change the company's value. But it can make shares more accessible. In the stock market, a
                stock split affects the total shares available. However, it doesn't impact the overall market capitalization.
            </p>
            <p>After a split, the share price goes down, which can attract retail investors. For existing shareholders, the
                total value of their investment stays the same. Even though they have more shares.</p>
            <p>The company's board might initiate a stock split to adjust the share price, increase stock liquidity, or attract
                a larger group of investors.</p>
            <h3>How Do Stock Splits Work?</h3>
            <p>A stock split is when a company increases its number of outstanding shares and lowers the price per share.
                Existing shareholders get more shares, but each share is worth less.</p>
            <p>The purpose of a stock split is to make shares more affordable to a wider range of investors. This can boost
                liquidity and attract more interest in the company's stock.</p>
            <p>Companies may choose to do stock splits to adjust share prices or increase stock liquidity. Although a stock
                split doesn't change a company's value, it can make shares more accessible to retail investors.</p>
            <p>By increasing the total number of shares available, a company's market capitalization stays the same, but the
                share price drops, appealing to new investors.</p>
            <p>In general, a stock split can potentially benefit existing shareholders by increasing the total value of their
                investment.</p>
            <h3>How Do Stock Splits Impact Share Price?</h3>
            <p>A stock split affects a company's share price in two ways. Firstly, it increases the number of outstanding
                shares. Secondly, it reduces the price per share. As a result, existing shareholders get more shares, but each
                share is worth less.</p>
            <p>There are several factors that can influence how a stock split impacts the share price. These include the split
                ratio, current market conditions, and investor sentiment.</p>
            <p>Shareholders can benefit from a company's choice to issue a stock split. It can potentially boost liquidity in
                the market and attract more investor interest. However, it does not alter the company's intrinsic value.
                Instead, it can make shares more accessible to retail investors and enhance the overall market value of the
                company.</p>
            <p>Understanding how stock splits affect share prices can help investors make well-informed decisions about their
                investment portfolios and trading strategies.</p>

                enhance the market value.</p>

            <h2>Benefits of Stock Splits</h2>
            <h3>Reasons Companies Issue Stock Splits</h3>
            <p>Stock splits are often used by companies to adjust their share prices and make their stock more liquid. They do
                this by increasing the number of shares available and decreasing the price of each share. This makes the stock
                more affordable to a wider range of investors, which can generate more interest in the market. While stock
                splits don't directly add value to shareholders, they can impact how investors see the company and make it
                easier for people to buy shares.</p>
            <p>This can attract more individual investors and lead to higher trading activity.</p>
            <h3>Value Addition for Shareholders</h3>

                <li>It may also generate more interest in the market.</li>
                <li>While a stock split doesn't change the company's value, it can impact how investors view the stock.</li>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>How does the stock split calculator work?</h3>
            <p>The stock split calculator works by inputting the number of shares owned before the split and the ratio of the
                split. For example, if you own 100 shares before a 2-for-1 split, input 100 as the pre-split shares and 2 as the
                split ratio to calculate the new number of shares and price per share after the split.</p>
            <h3>Can I input multiple stock splits at once?</h3>
            <p>No, you can typically only input stock splits one at a time in most platforms like brokerage accounts or stock
                tracking apps. Each split will need to be entered individually with the relevant information such as the ratio
                and effective date.</p>
            <h3>Is the stock split calculator free to use?</h3>
            <p>Yes, the stock split calculator is free to use. You can input stock data and calculate potential effects of a
                stock split without any cost or registration.</p>
            <h3>Does the calculator take into account fractional shares?</h3>
            <p>Yes, the calculator does take into account fractional shares. For example, if you enter that you own 1.5 shares
                of a stock, the calculator will calculate the value of those 1.5 shares accordingly.</p>
            <h3>Can I use the calculator for both forward and reverse stock splits?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can use the calculator for both forward and reverse stock splits. For example, if a stock undergoes a
                2-for-1 stock split (forward), you would enter "2" in the calculator. If it undergoes a 1-for-2 reverse stock
                split, you would enter "0.5".</p>
