            <h3>Factors Affecting Mortgage Calculations</h3>
            <p>Interest rates affect how much you pay for a mortgage. Higher rates mean higher monthly payments and more
                interest over time. Lower rates mean lower payments and savings in the long run.</p>
            <p>The loan term is also important. Shorter terms have higher monthly payments but less interest overall. Longer
                terms have lower monthly payments but higher total interest costs.</p>
            <p>Your credit score is crucial too. Higher scores mean lower rates, saving money on interest. Lenders check credit
                scores to decide on loan terms and offer better deals to those with higher scores.</p>
            <h3>Tips for Effective Mortgage Planning</h3>
