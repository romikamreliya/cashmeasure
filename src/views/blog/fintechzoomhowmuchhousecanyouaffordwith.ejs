            <h3>Factors Affecting Mortgage Calculations</h3>
            <p>Credit score affects mortgage calculations by determining the interest rate offered to borrowers. Higher scores
                lead to lower rates and costs, while lower scores result in higher rates, making borrowing more expensive. Good
                credit makes borrowers less risky, attracting lenders for mortgage loans.</p>
            <p>Debt-to-income ratio helps decide the affordable mortgage amount. A lower ratio shows more income for payments,
                increasing loan approval chances. Managing this ratio ensures borrowers can pay without financial strain.</p>
            <p>Down payment is vital for home loan affordability. More upfront payment lowers the mortgage, decreasing costs and
                risks for both borrower and lender. Planning for a substantial down payment eases the buying process, securing
                better mortgage terms for long-term financial stability.</p>

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What factors should I consider when determining how much house I can afford?</h3>
            <p>Consider factors like your income, credit score, existing debts, and down payment. Rule of thumb is to aim for a
                house that costs no more than three times your annual income. Use online calculators to estimate monthly
                payments. Budget for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs.</p>
            <h3>How does my credit score affect how much house I can afford?</h3>
            <p>A higher credit score usually allows you to qualify for a lower interest rate on a mortgage loan, which can
                increase the amount of house you can afford. For example, a difference of just one percentage point in interest
                rate on a 30-year mortgage can save you thousands of dollars over the life of the loan.</p>
            <h3>Should I focus on the mortgage amount or the total cost of the house when budgeting?</h3>
            <p>Focus on the total cost of the house when budgeting, including expenses beyond the mortgage amount like property
                taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This ensures you have a comprehensive understanding of all financial
                obligations related to the home purchase.</p>
            <h3>What role does my income play in determining how much house I can afford?</h3>
            <p>Your income plays a significant role in determining how much house you can afford. As a general rule, your total
                housing expenses should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. For example, if your gross monthly income
                is $5,000, you should aim to keep your housing expenses under $1,400 per month.</p>
            <h3>Are there any tools or calculators that can help me figure out how much house I can afford?</h3>
            <p>Yes, there are many online mortgage calculators available such as those offered by Bankrate, NerdWallet, and
                Zillow that can help you determine how much house you can afford based on your income, expenses, and desired
                down payment.</p>
