                <h3>Key Components and Market Cap Weightings</h3>
                <p>The DAX40 includes industry leaders like Volkswagen, Siemens, SAP, and Adidas. Companies are weighted based on their market capitalization, meaning larger firms like SAP hold more influence over the index’s performance. This weighting system ensures the DAX40 reflects economic realities and market movements accurately.</p>
        
                <h3>Trading Hours and Market Sessions</h3>
                <p>The DAX40 operates during the Frankfurt Stock Exchange's hours, from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM CET. Many traders take advantage of overlaps with other major markets, such as London or New York, to enhance liquidity and volatility opportunities.</p>

                <h3>Original Capital Requirements</h3>
